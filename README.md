## âœ¨ Core Functionalities
- âœ… Create a new account
- âœ… Deposit money
- âœ… Withdraw money
- âœ… Display account details
- âœ… Edit account information
- âœ… Exit the system

The system leverages **structures** and **arrays** to efficiently manage account information. *(Optional file handling can also be integrated.)*

## ðŸš€ Features
- User-friendly console interface
- Colored text output for better readability and UX
- Support for multiple accounts
- Basic error handling (e.g., invalid account numbers, insufficient funds)
- Clear and organized code structure for beginners

---

## ðŸ“š Technologies Used
- **C++ Programming Language**
- **Standard Libraries**: `<iostream>`, `<string>`
- **ANSI Escape Sequences** for colorful console outputs

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose
This project is designed as a **beginner-friendly** C++ exercise to practice:
- Structs and array management
- Console-based application building
- Basic banking system logic
- Input/output handling and formatting

---

## ðŸ”¥ Future Enhancements
- Integrate file handling to store account data persistently
- Implement a password/login system for better security
- Improve input validation and exception handling
- Upgrade to a full GUI-based system (using libraries like Qt or SFML)
